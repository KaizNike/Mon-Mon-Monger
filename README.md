# Mon Mon Monger
 Minimalistic Python3 text game. Become a friend to Beasts in a varied world.

## Playing
 Install Python v3.12+ and run it in your preferred terminal. The use of match queries make it nessecary to run 3.10+.

## Contributing
 Is welcome, there are no guidelines right now other than not to pull request code refactors unless I give you the go ahead in Issues. I intend this to be a light side project while I work on a RPG so bring monster ideas, translations and more to Issues.
